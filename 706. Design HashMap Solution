Solution
So in this problem, we are asked to design a HashMap without using any library functions. Here we are going to discuss two approaches to this problem.

Approach 1 â€” Array: With this approach, we will initialize an array of a certain size with -
1. I will use the given key as the index of the array and will store the given value in the array with that index.
I can use this method because the key is always positive. This is a pretty straight forward code.

class MyHashMap {
    int[] data;

    public MyHashMap() {
        data = new int[1000001];
        Arrays.fill(data, -1);
    }

    public void put(int key, int val) {
        data[key] = val;
    }

    public int get(int key) {
        return data[key];
    }

    public void remove(int key) {
        data[key] = -1;
    }
}
